This Project's Goal,Repeating and reinforcing relationships with Spring Boot Project

### Relations Types

- One-To-One : If both of the fields we will use to provide the relationship are in their own tables, the primary key is a one-to-one relationship.

- One-To-Many : If one of the fields we will use to provide the relationship is the primary key and the other is a foreign key, it will be a one-to-many relationship.

- Many-To-Many : If one of the fields we use to establish the relationship is the primary key and the other is the foreign key and a different table must be used to establish the relationship, it is a many-to-many relationship.
